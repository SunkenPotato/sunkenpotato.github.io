As some may know, I had another website before this. I made it myself, since I thought,

Nope. I'm **awful** at CSS. The elements were overflowing, grid elements not filling grids, etc., etc. \
So I'm using the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme instead by [panr](https://github.com/panr).
It's looking pretty good for now, and I'm happy about how it's turned out.

I'm now working on a Cloud-storage application called Homebase, made in Rust and Java(FX).
